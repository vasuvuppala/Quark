  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  By definition each project is unique. Projects differ in their sizes, schedules, complexity, criticality, 
  and resources needs. Hence, no process infrastructure can be optimal for all projects. 
  This is true for Quark too. However, Quark's processes can be adjusted to suit the project.
  This adjustment of processes is known as process tailoring. Tailoring does not imply that
  the processes can be changed at will, the adjustments are limited. 
  This document explains how to tailor Quark's processes for your project.
